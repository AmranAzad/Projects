# Bangladesh bank data cleaning

This project is about cleaning the data as efficiently as possible. I was provided this data by a senior of my college who wanted me to clean for fun. (He scrapped The Bangladesh Bank website for the data)

Problems in the raw csv:
- Had way more columns than needed
- Had to iterate through the list to figure out how to remove unwanted blank spaces
